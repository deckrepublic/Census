This is my program for analyzing the 1990 census data record.

I use a custom writable data type for efficiency requiring me to only pass through a record once while mapping.
This allows me to use the same mapper and combiner class for every question which is also another form of efficiency.

My mapper class maps all of the raw data to BookRecord data type which is the value, and the Key is the state abbreviation and 
then passes to the combiner.
My combiner class takes all values in a Iterable<BookRecord> and adds them together getting the combination of all records into one 
record for a state and then passes that record to the reducer.
My reducer class then takes the record for each set of states that it has and computes the question statistics and writes the answer to 
the context and finishes. 

I have decided to only use one reducer as I have not notice a drastic difference in performance if I use more than one, It is also convenient
because all answer for every state is in one file. 

Q1 I add togther the values for number of homes owned and rented then find the percentages based on that.
Q2 I add together the values for males never married, married, seperated, and widowed then divide never married by the total number.
Q3 I add together the values for all the ranges of age in gender, then find the appropiate range for both genders and divide to get percentages.
